### 🛠 About Me
Full-stack software engineer with 4+ years of experience building web and mobile applications—and debugging things I swear worked yesterday. Currently, I’m a founding engineer at Dealflow, a Danish fintech startup, crafting a next-gen invoicing platform to make payments faster (because who likes waiting for money?). Before that, I helped scale CreditBook, an accounting app empowering SMEs in Pakistan.

When I’m not wrangling code, you’ll find me on the cricket pitch, pretending I’m the next Virat Kohli, or enjoying an existential tea break in Karachi. ☕
